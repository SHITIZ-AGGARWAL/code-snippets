# Contributing Guidelines

Read README.md file before moving forward

To contribute to this repository and add  code snippets, the following pointers should be kept in mind to avoid merge conflicts and other problems such as a bad PR while contributing:

- Create a markdown file with a suitable name according to your snippet. Make sure the code snippet is not already in the codebase and is in the correct sub-directory.


- Add the snippet and output in the appropriate block. For example, for a java snippet:
    ~~~
    ```java
    print("code snippet here")
    ```
    ~~~
4. You can add a **Description** sub-heading if you want to provide an explanation! 


## Do not add pure code files, add your snippets in the code blocks in the markdown file.
